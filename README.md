# 100-cell-calculation
This project was created for studying java, when I started studying programming.

## How To Use
Execute the following commands.
```
javac HyakuMasu.java
```

```
java HyakuMasu
```

And then, a table of 100 (10 x 10) squares and a formula will appear (it is randomly generated), so please solve them steadily. 
Whether the formula is addition or multiplication is random.
```
  | 9 | 8 | 6 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 8 | 7 | 3 | 9 |
 8|__ |__ |__ |__ |__ |__ |__ |__ |__ |__ |

8+9=?
->
```
If you answer correctly, <b>"o"</b> will be added to the table.<br>
On the other hand, if you answer incorrectry, <b>"x"</b> will be added to the table.<br>
After solving 100 questions, you can see the number of correct answers.<br>

```
正解数は11/100です。
お疲れ様でした
```

Aim for 100 correct answers. Good luck!
